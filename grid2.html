            On October 28, Latin America's largest democracy elected a president whose campaign was propelled by
            violence, vicious rumors of fraud and a cascade of online news and information that has proven to be false.

            President-elect Jair Bolsonaro, a former army captain who has served in Brazil's National Congress since
            1991, openly expresses misogynistic and homophobic views and recently vowed to “put an end to all activism
            in Brazil.’’

            Just ten days before the final vote, Bolsonaro’s campaign was found to have spent $3 million to spread news
            on WhatsApp. Folha de São Paulo, one of the most important news outlets in Brazil, uncovered the scheme
            that laid bare the possible roots of many of the viral, divisive messages and false reports that spread on
            social media in Brazil during the months before the election. Despite efforts by multiple fact-checking
            groups, and some interventions by Facebook, disinformation appears to have played a major role in
            Bolsonaro’s campaign.

            Those who have sought to expose disinformation efforts have also paid a price for it. Shortly after Folha
            de São Paulo reporter Patricia Campos Mello wrote about the $3 million WhatsApp scheme, she began receiving
            threats and had her personal WhatsApp account hacked. The attackers erased a few of her conversations and
            sent pro-Bolsonaro messages to her contacts. A reporter at Estado de São Paulo, a different newspaper, was
            doxxed after writing a follow up to Mello’s story. According to the Brazilian Association of Investigative
            Journalism (ABRAJI), there have been 141 cases of threats and violence against journalists registered
            during the coverage of 2018 elections.

            Bolsonaro’s campaign may face tough questions from Brazil’s judiciary, as the WhatsApp scheme may have
            violated Brazilian election and data protection laws. But for now, the far-right candidate is sitting
            proud, preparing for his inauguration and actively communicating with his followers on WhatsApp.
