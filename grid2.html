                <p>On October 28, Latin America's largest democracy elected a president whose campaign was propelled by
                    violence, vicious rumors of fraud and a cascade of online news and information that has proven to
                    be false.

                    President-elect Jair Bolsonaro, a former army captain who has served in Brazil's National Congress
                    since
                    1991, openly expresses misogynistic and homophobic views and recently vowed to “put an end to all
                    activism
                    in Brazil.’’

                    Just ten days before the final vote, Bolsonaro’s campaign was found to have spent $3 million to
                    spread news
                    on WhatsApp. Folha de São Paulo, one of the most important news outlets in Brazil, uncovered the
                    scheme
                    that laid bare the possible roots of many of the viral, divisive messages and false reports that
                    spread on
                    social media in Brazil during the months before the election. Despite efforts by multiple
                    fact-checking
                    groups, and some interventions by Facebook, disinformation appears to have played a major role in
                    Bolsonaro’s campaign.

                    Those who have sought to expose disinformation efforts have also paid a price for it. Shortly after
                    Folha
                    de São Paulo reporter Patricia Campos Mello wrote about the $3 million WhatsApp scheme, she began
                    receiving
                    threats and had her personal WhatsApp account hacked. The attackers erased a few of her
                    conversations and
                    sent pro-Bolsonaro messages to her contacts. A reporter at Estado de São Paulo, a different
                    newspaper, was
                    doxxed after writing a follow up to Mello’s story. According to the Brazilian Association of
                    Investigative
                    Journalism (ABRAJI), there have been 141 cases of threats and violence against journalists
                    registered
                    during the coverage of 2018 elections.

                    Bolsonaro’s campaign may face tough questions from Brazil’s judiciary, as the WhatsApp scheme may
                    have
                    violated Brazilian election and data protection laws. But for now, the far-right candidate is
                    sitting
                    proud, preparing for his inauguration and actively communicating with his followers on WhatsApp.
